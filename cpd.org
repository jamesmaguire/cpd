Project 9011 Green Square Stage 4 Excavation - IV

- SEA Independant verification
- Structural report by VDM did not provide the typical necessary results to assess against SW guidelines and calcs hid the fact that the culvert did not pass
- Pressure from client to get the report out same day
- It was discovered that the loading exceeded both the SW guidelines and in some cases the ULS strength under the post-development loading provided by geotech assessment
- Client notified about the issue. We positioned ourselves as not delaying the package submission but as saving the client time of submitting and having the development rejected by SW
- Resolution: geotechnical report was revised based on geotech IV recommendations that the original analysis was overly conservative. Under the revised loading the culvert passed the SW loading guidelines for SEA

- Hydrophylic material can be used for non-hydrostatic
- Hydrostatic - using SB admixture

- Secant pile vertical cold joints treated with Penecreate mortar
- Penebar installed horizontally within slab
- Penebar min cover 55mm

- Admixture is only suitable for static cracking, isn't going to work for dynamic loading
- BS8102/2009 gives watertightness specifications

- Carbon dioxide + carbon hydroxide = calcium carbonate + water
- Calcium carbonate lowers pH below 9 so corrosion can occur
- Cut the water element prevents corrosion

- Chloride attack near to sea
- Cut the water element prevents corrosion

** WALLAP training session
SCHEDULED: [2021-07-02 Wed 15:30-17:30]

- Presenter :: Dave Southgate

*** Setting up the model
1. Input soil parameters -> can choose soil params from linked file
   (good for same site)
2. For Ka/Ko F1 allows choice of \phi
3. Wall FE (finite element) length -> auto calculated
4. Make sure prop area is large enough otherwise it won't grab. Check
   moment diagram to confirm.
5. Prop free length -> length of prop in active soil block (take as
   45deg. from wall which is conservative)
   - NB. shoring contractor will give free length + props. We should
     provide free length minimum value.
6. Prop prestress set to zero for initial analysis.
7. Excavate 500 below prop press f1 26 a tag to to give space for
   install
8. BM options: nonlinear modulus parameter -> set to wall height
9. Run analysis. Check deflection and prop forces -> NB. horo
   component only is shown by WALLAP
10. Lock off load should be 60-70% of the final load
    
*** Notes
- Deflection should be small if sensitive structures around (20mm or less). To be agreed upon with geotech and client.
- Rule of thumb: one anchor per basement level. we can cantilever one floor at top.
- Email: /Geotechnical design parameters - from Thomas/ - consernative values.
- tanδ/tanɸ : wall friction coefficient for cohesive soil -> set to 0.667 for cohesive soils
- Don't directly engage geotech since they aren't insured
- Shorings AH likes 2.8m, DS likes 2.4m spacing for soldier piles. Unless smaller required
- Anchor -> 15deg gives good balance between min free length & cos angle (for load)
- Bug: young's modulus won't go past 2e7 when 2e8 is needed. Go back to update

** Design notes
*** Layout
- Prelim spacing is dependant on required P/A for crack control.
  1.4MPa for moderate control
- Edge stressing preferable
- Otherwise live ends should be 1m from obstructions and otherwise
  0.8m from edge (where edge stress not allowed but not obstructed)

*** Top reo
- Required to carry 25% of negative moment in column + 2* half mid
  spans
- Use a min of 4N16s in each direction

** PT Macro export
1. Save PTD file
2. Label the tendons clockwise in order of:
   - Xmin
   - Ymax
   - Xmax
   - Ymin
3. Check the number of tendons labelled (T01 -- TN) is correct
4. Run and save the PTD model
5. Export the drape values at high points (=Settings > Viewing >
   Tendons > High points= = =True=) with =Reports > Duct profiles= to
   =DuctHeight_report.$hlp.txt=
6. Repeat for mid/low points in =DuctHeight_report.$mp.txt=
7. Open Excel macro file and enter path/file locations in =Home= tab and
   run the =Shop Drawings= macro
8. For Xmin, Ymax, Xmax and Ymin (in order) take the corresponding
   values from the =Tendon NS= tab and paste to a spare space in the
   =Tendon No= tab
9. Take the min/max value and for each value in the column replace
   with the datum value
10. Click the =Strand Number Location= macro
11. Save the excel macro file
12. Open the CAD template and delete any drawings still there
13. Run VBAMAN and load =Import v1.XX.dvb=
14. Click =Macros= and run the macro, giving the correct path and
    filename of the excel macro workbook
15. Check and save the CAD dwg

** Deflection plots

- From :: Aidan McCabe

Just got a walkthrough by Dave on how he produces his deflection
plots. Thought I’d put it down into words so we can be consistent
across the office.

1. Open PTD file. Solve model and display deflection. Make sure your
   mesh is refined as much as possible (Dave likes 0.75m) and you have
   colours displayed in your deflections.
2. Take a screen shot of legend in top left of deflection plot.
3. Export this display to CAD.
4. In CAD, freeze the following
   - Text at bottom of export
   - Slab outline
5. In CAD, scale the output up (should be by 1000).
6. Drafters can then use this file to import into their drawing set.
   Send them the .dxf and the saved legend. They have a template set
   up for the legend where they can simply enter the numbers for that
   plot.

This process should be repeated for long term and short term
deflections. Often the deflection plot itself won’t look any different
between short and long term so the same plot can be used with two
legends on the sheet, one for each case.

*** Section 3 - Strength and serviceability design
**** Design for
1. Ultimate strength
2. Serviceability
3. Durability
4. Other (as required by client)

**** Ultimate strength
Design geotechnical strength and design structural strength must be
greater than design action effect:
- $R_{d,g} \ge E_d$
- $R_{d,s} \ge E_d$

Actions specified in AS 1170.0

***** R_d,ug
$R_{d,ug} = f_{m,s}A_s + (f_b + p_o)A_b - W$ and, assuming $W =
A_{b}p_{o}$ $R_{d,ug} = f_{m,s}A_s + f_{b}A_b$

**** Serviceability
Pile displacement $\delta$ should be controlled.

* [2021-05-21 Fri] Structural integrity reinforcement

*AS3600:2018 Section 9.2*

** Integrity reinforcement
*** Email from Daruis
Afternoon All!

I’ve been working on a couple of projects where I have been
considering our favourite topic…Integrity Reinforcement.

For the Engineers, see below for a detailed run down.

For the drafters…be aware that we are now required to add extra
reinforcement bars directly over our columns (in the bottom
reinforcement) – see attached PDF markup for a typical slab.

Clause 9.2 Structural Integrity Reinforcement

We are still debating what is exactly required and are trying to
utilize our PT strand as a way of minimizing the extent, however the
code does not allow us to consider PT strand at the moment (despite
zero testing or theory backing this up). In any case, in order to
achieve compliance with Clause 9.2, we must detail an amount of
reinforcement over the columns in the bottom reinforcement layer which
is directly related to the ultimate reaction N* for the particular
column under consideration.

The summation of the reinforcement at a particular column is given by
equation 9.2.2 reproduced below:

To calculate N*, work out the tributary area and multiply by your
ultimate load case (1.2G + 1.5Q).

These bars are required to be placed WITHIN the column core and they
must extend a minimum 2 x Lsy.tb from the face of the column, and
should be cogged at discontinuous edges.

This means, that the length of the bar will be dependent on the bar
diameter selected, and hence, ideally we would select the smallest bar
size possible, however we are restricted to keeping the bars within
the column core, and so this will not always be possible.

The other thing is, we are not required to have an even amount of bars
in each direction of the column (i.e. 3N16’s EW). We simply need a
minimum of 2 bars or 2 strands in each direction (Cl. 9.2.1).
Therefore, we could potentially have 2N16’s in one direction and
4N16’s in the other direction.

As an example, I have attached a copy of a typical 200mm thick slab
for a post tension job I am looking at. The first page is a markup of
the integrity reinforcement required for the deck, the second page
shows the trib. area for each column in blue, and in green is the
integrity reinforcement required for each column based on equation
9.2.2.

I have also attached a spreadsheet that I am working on in order to
simplify the design process for us. This is under development and I
will look to improve this to speed this process up as much as
possible.

Numerical Example Let’s consider the column above the top right hand
side of the core as shown below:

As you can see above, the trib area for the column is 48.4m2. Now we
will use the spreadsheet to calculate our required integrity
reinforcement for the column.

If you open the spreadsheet up, you will see this:

Only red text requires an input, everything else will be calculated
for you.

From the top work through the “Basic development length” inputs in
red.

Input f’c, D (slab depth), cover, fsy, db (bar diameter), spacing; in
this example I have decided to use N16 bars initially.

This will generate your basic development length (yellow rectangle).

Next, enter your column dimensions, trib area and your pressure loads.
The spreadsheet will calculate you slab self weight from the depth you
provided in the basic development length above.

This will then generate the total area you need to satisfy the
integrity reo (green box), and in the pink box, it will call up the
number of bars you require for that bar size.

I have also calculated the lengths required for your bars for an
internal column and an edge column (external span).

So for this example, we can get away with 12N16’s (note I have used
13N16’s in my markup as I have rounded up and am using this deck as an
exercise for a client).

Now, say you can’t fit 12N16’s in your column, you will need to
increase the bar size, let’s try N20’s.

Simply change the bar size you originally selected to 20 and the
spreadsheet will do the rest:

We now only require 8N20’s, but note how the required bar lengths have
increased significantly!

This will likely be a topic we will re-visit on our training day on
the 6th of December.

In the meantime though, engineers please read through Clause 9.2 of
AS3600 (2018) and get yourselves familiar with the clause as it will
likely be here to stay.
